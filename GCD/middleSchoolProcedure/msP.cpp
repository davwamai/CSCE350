// step-1: find the prime factors of m 
// step-2: find the prime factors of n 
// step-3: indentify all the common factors betwen these two lists
		if p occurs p_m times, in m and p_n times in n, then it should be repeated min(p_m, p_n) times. 
// step-4: compute the product of all common factors and return it as the GCD
