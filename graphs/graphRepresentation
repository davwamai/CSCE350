-- adjacency matrix
	matrix denotes whether you can go from rowNum to colNum with a single edge (line) 
--adjacency linked lists
	nodes are placed in the list normally, pointers between nodes denote edges.
--weighted graphs 
	edges have weights, can be represented with an adjacency matrix

	a	b	c	d
   a	inf	5	1	inf
   b	5	inf	7	4
   c	1	7	inf	2
   d	inf 	4	2	inf 


--how to use an adjacency linked list. denote edges with the node connected and the weights comma delimited
	a --> b,5 --> c,1 

	b --> a,5 --> c,7 --> d,4

	c --> a,1 --> b,7 --> d,2
 
	d --> b,4 --> c,2

--cyclic graphs 
	A path of positive length that starts and ends at the same vertex
	
--acyclic graphs 
	do not have any cycles in them 
	
--connected graph 
	graph that has a path between any two vertices. 
--sets of acyclic conencted graphsthat form one acyclic unconnected graph are called forrests. 
--a graph that is conencted and acyclcic is called a tree
--rooted trees, as comapred to free trees, has a 'root' with multiple children below it. Think BinSearch
